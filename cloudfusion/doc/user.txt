Start CloudFusion
---------------------

Make a directory for the logs::

	mkdir -p .cloudfusion/logs

Or instead change the logging configuration in *cloudfusion/config/logging.conf* to specify another location for log files.

To run the application make a directory mnt and from your home directory call: 

	python -m cloudfusion.main mnt 


Create a Configuration File
------------------------------------

Sugarsync
++++++++++
Copy the Sugarsync configuration file located at **cloudfusion/cloudfusion/config/Sugarsync.ini** to your home directory.
Edit the configuration file by adding your e-mail address as your username and a password. 


Dropbox
++++++++++
Simply copy the Dropbox configuration file located at **cloudfusion/cloudfusion/config/Dropbox.ini** to your home directory.
If you do not have a Dropbox account already, you can create a new one at https://www.dropbox.com.
No further steps are required. 


Configuring CloudFusion
------------------------------------

Now copy the configuration file you edited to your mountpoint::

    cp ~/db.ini mnt/config/config

This assumes that you saved the configuration file as **db.ini** to your home directory. 
If you simply copied the configuration file as suggested, replace **db.ini** with **Sugarsync.ini** or **Dropbox.ini** respectively.
If you use Dropbox, your webbrowser will prompt you to login into Dropbox and grant access rights to CloudFusion. 
The current time limit for this is one minute. If you did not make it in time, copying the configuration file fails.
But you can simply retry by copying the configuration again

Enjoy accessing your files in the directory **mnt/data**.

 

Advanced Usage:
-------------------------------
 
Advanced options can be set dynamically by changing parameters in the file *mnt/config/config*::

	#Approximate cache size limit in MB; default 2000:
	cache_size = 5000
	#Identifier for persistent database. Use one id per cloud account to keep the cache after application shutdown.
	#Default value is a random number.
	cache_id = dropboxacc1
